Jarvis AI is a virtual assistant project designed to perform a wide range of tasks using voice commands. Built with Python, JavaScript, and various APIs, Jarvis offers a seamless interaction through voice recognition and natural language processing. It can automate tasks like opening applications, playing YouTube videos, sending WhatsApp messages, and much more.

Features:

*Voice Command Recognition: Utilizes Google’s Speech Recognition API to understand and execute voice commands.

*Task Automation: Automate tasks like opening applications or websites, controlling media, sending messages, and making calls using pre-programmed commands.

*YouTube Integration: Search and play videos directly from YouTube using just your voice.

*WhatsApp Automation: Send messages, make voice calls, or video calls via WhatsApp.

*Chatbot Integration: Uses HugChat for natural conversational responses when commands aren't recognized.

*Hotword Detection: Supports hotword activation (e.g., "Jarvis" or "Alexa") using Porcupine for a hands-free experience.

*Cross-Platform: Works on both web and desktop environments, with an intuitive interface for users to type or speak commands.

Technologies Used:

-Python: Core functionality for processing commands, automating tasks, and handling APIs.

-JavaScript & Eel: Provides the frontend interface and real-time communication between the web and Python backend.
